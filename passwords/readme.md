Harvester.py is a little script i wrote to help in the pulling of NTLM Hashes from HDD Images. Given that HDDs are stored in a simple tree thi script will append all the Windows/System32/Config paths and dump the SYSTEM and SAM hives. PWDUMP needs to be installed for this to work as this script is a simple wrapper around the pwdump python script
